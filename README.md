# MSc-Deep-Learning

This repository contains my assignement for my deep learning course. I choose to study image classification and to compare the following networks: 

- AlexNet,
- VGGNet,
- GoogLeNet / Inception,
- ResNet,
- SqueezeNet,
- PreActResNet,
- DenseNet,
- ResNeXt,
- DPN,
- NASNet,
- SENet,
- MobileNet.

To do so I gathered and studied the publications where those networks are described and ran their reference implementations using the CIFAR-10 dataset (50000 test images belonging to 10 classes) using PyTorch when possible.
